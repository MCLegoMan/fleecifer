# FAQ
- **Is this compatible with Fabric Loader?**
  - I am going to keep this mod updated with [Quilt Loader](https://quiltmc.org/), that being said, some versions are compatible with Fabric Loader, and are tagged with Fabric on the versions page.
  - I would recommend trying out [Quilt Loader](https://quiltmc.org/), as it's mostly a drop-in replacement for Fabric Loader - even mods that are only tagged as fabric are likely to work with quilt with [QSL](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl) replacing fabric-api.

  - Yes, you can use this mod in modpacks or videos.
- **Will you port this mod to 1.x.x?**
