    - Yes, you can use this mod in modpacks or videos.
- **Will you backport this mod?**
    - I am unlikely to port to specific versions, as this mod was made for fun. However, other developers are free to port this mod, as long as they adhere to the conditions of the LGPL-3.0-or-later license.
- **Can I remove the re-texturing of the sheep?**
    - The eyes are separate textures located at `fleecifer:textures/entity/sheep/sheep_eyes.png`, and `fleecifer:textures/entity/sheep/sheep_eyes_emissive.png`, which you could replace with blank textures using a resource pack.
